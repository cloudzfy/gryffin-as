### IVR Media Resource Controller in JAIN SLEE
Copyright (C) 2013 Cloudzfy. All Rights Reserved.

========================================================

### Overview
This project is an **Interactive Voice Response (IVR)** System for **IP Multimedia Subsystem** based (IMS-based) value added service, which is efficiently for lower cost of management. This project is designed as a media resource controller, which can strongly integrate speech resources, for the purpose of providing efficient and flexible self-service. 

### The Origin
At first, this project is designed as a subsystem of **intelligent apartment** for elderly in Hongfu Group, Beijing, China, and focused on visitor management of apartment for the convenient of the old people's relatives and friends. And now it has been extended as a research project of IMS-based Media Resource Controller in JAIN SLEE.

### Design & Technology
With a carrier-grade Execution Environment - **JAIN SLEE** technology, this is a research project on IMS-based IVR system. The design patterns is followed the standard JAIN SLEE Specification, so you can easily comprehend the source code and help us improve the system. It is related to the project [Mobicents JAIN SLEE](http://www.mobicents.org/slee/intro.html).

With the integration of **VoiceXML**, this application server can be extended fast and easily. The only thing you have to do is to configure the VoiceXML document to meet your functional need. This function is related to the project **JVoiceXML** - A Java VoiceXML Interpreter. More information please visit here: [http://jvoicexml.sourceforge.net](http://jvoicexml.sourceforge.net).

This project uses **MRCPv2** protocol to communicate with Speech Server, and it has to use a MRCPv2 Resource Adaptor in JAIN SLEE. This resource Adaptor is also a part of this project, and you can see it here: [http://cloudzfy.github.io/mrcp-ra/](http://cloudzfy.github.io/mrcp-ra/).

The test platform of speech server in this project is **UniMRCP**. You can find more information on UniMRCP here: [http://www.unimrcp.org](http://www.unimrcp.org).

This project may use IMS environment for the normal use of all functions. The test platform of IMS environment in this project is **Open IMS Core**. You can find more information on Open IMS Core here: [http://www.openimscore.org](http://www.openimscore.org).

### Vision
This project have finished the requirement of prototype development of apartment for elderly access control and call center system, which is made a contribution to apartment for elderly and the business design of IMS area.

### About Author
This project is designed by @cloudzfy as a graduation project in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China. And it is also a prospective study on self-service access control system, which belongs the Communication Software Laboratory, School of Software Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
